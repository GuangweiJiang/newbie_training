Today my foermost task is knowing more linux orders.
Facing the new operating system which is called linux,I feel powerless at first.Suddenly I get something ,when I read a book that the leader recommend for me about linux.From the book I have a new understanding about the operating system. Using the system in a text mode is better than graphical interface,especially for the problem of install.It will easily grasp the operational state of linux.Also,it is convenient to know the meaning of the system install.
That is to say,I need to know more orders about linux  and word processor.There are some orders commonly used,include cat cd cp mkdir ls git and so on.
Next stage ,I will be committed to learning driven development.Meanwhile,it is important to be skilled of linux orders.
