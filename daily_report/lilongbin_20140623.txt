	I get up early in the morning, I am so happy. I made a plan that from today on I will get up early everyday to read some English and have a substantial breakfast.
	I took a book named "embeded software development" and a cup with my hand. I think we should make full use of time and should pay attention to protect good body. This means that I will drink more water everyday.
	When I arrive at our office, I start to configurate the computer's environment. I haven't forgot that from 2009 I started to use ubuntu and about one year later I found that ubuntu update too fast and its stability is not so good as redhat enterprise edition, so I began to install fedora and then centos some months later, because these are both released by redhat inc. In use for many years, I have been accustomed to use the centos.
	It took me a lot of time configruring the Ubuntu. I installed the adobe flash player on the firefox explorer and the stardict software which could be uesed to translate between Chinese and English. then I transformed the paths of directories from Chinese to English name, which could be convenient to switching each other.
	Then I learned some courses about linux kernel module inserting and removing. I met a trouble that when I want to print a message when the kernel module was inserted or removed, the message couldn't be printed. I increased the print level of printk, but failed. Finally, Director Jiang told me we could use dmesg to see the messages we want to print. In the actual development, we used to using uart to read the messages not the host machine.
	I realized that we still have a long way to go. One is never too old to learn.
