Today I have two tasks to do.
In the morning I mainly do a research on the N0.8 traning about GPIO.About the
GPIO my colleague Albert gives me a dirction, when I feel puzzled. He gives
me a data book about the ARM and tells me the usages of the registers.
In the afternoon I mainly listen the courses of new training online.There are
five courses I must learn.Two of them need to be tested.They are MFG_KM 
introduction and SA8000 stardard introduction.
Tomorrow I will be committed to learn how to set up hudson and to configure.
