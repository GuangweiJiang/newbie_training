  Today is Monday.The weather is not so hot,because
the fall is coming.I have not had time to buy breakfast
,fortunately,I have a bottle of rice pudding in the office.
  In the morning,I review the previous knowledge.I learn 
what is VFS,and the working principle of VFS.Then I analysis
how process transfer parameters to driver through the VFS.
Parameters need go through two stages to set to driver.Although
 this is knowledge of application,it is helpful to understand 
the whole development process.
  In the afternoon,I learn the linux device driver about GPIO.
It cost me several days.Now I know how to complete it.
