I have a life without linux in the last twenty days. So,my first thing is
getting myself in the job,when I get back today.
To tell the turth,I am not familer with the linux code. That means I spend most
time on that  to review the important code today. Also,I learn something about
regular expression and know the importance for the system manager. In short,the
regular expression is a way in which people deal with the problems about
strings. It is important for me to know the system.
At last ,I read a chapter on shell. It is like a file to get many orders
together. Then when we  use the file,the orders also will work. I will never
give up learning shell,when I begin to know the linux clearly.
