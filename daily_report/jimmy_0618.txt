   I got up early this morning today.last night is Very cold.I need to buy a quilt today after work.
Today traffic is heavy.There is no seat in factory car.Then i walk to factory with a lot of Sweat.
To the company, I found that I was the first to arrive.I feel good performance at second working day.
I get my own photos from HR.Wokemate tell me how to lean drive.He give me a book about drive.I have 
read a book all morning.I learn a lot about linux drive.
  At noon I eat lunch with workmates in the cafeteria.This food is not good because i may be late.
At noon I rest for an hour.The company is quite humanized.The director tell me the daily report is not
bad.It need to be fixed.then i check the daily report for 20 minutes.Today i talk to many with workmate 
beside me.He tell me some things about work.I am full of confidence.I think I can go through training.
