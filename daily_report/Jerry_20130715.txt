 Today I keep having the new staff training.
 There are four lessons I have to learn. One of the lessons which is teached by
 the boss. The lesson is about  the specificationS of work space. The boss does
 not tell us many rules about the work space. He tells us something about the
 quality of life ,but he never brings out the facts and reasons. He gives us
 some examples of his experience. For instance,the boss asked him to finish
 the three works on schedule. That does not mean you can go home after finishing
 the three works on time. We should ask the boss to check and accept the works
 and do some another works which is helpful for our careers and the company.
 The point leaves a deep impression on me .
