Today I begin the NO.6 exercise of the linux driver training.
The exercise is about time, delays, and deferred work. In the real device
driver it usually has the functions of timing and memory management .The
exercise will help me tell the difference of time ,compare with time ,git
the real time  and so on. I read some books  about the  jiffies  ,time_
after(_eq), time_before(_eq),  mdelay ,HZ .They are widely used to the
training programming.
Tomorrow I will keep write the programming until finishing the exercise.
