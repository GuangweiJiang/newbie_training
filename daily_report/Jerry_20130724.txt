Today I keep doing the NO.6 exercise of the linux driver training.
First of all, I write the programming of the current time.It is not very 
difficult for me. Then I begin to measure time lapses and compare times in the
programming.In this turn I do not understand well at first,but I make it after
refering the examples online.At last the function of delaying operation for a
specified amount of time makes me puzzled.I do not have a good condition,maybe
I did not sleep well last night.
Tommorrow I hope that I will keep a nice status to learn.
