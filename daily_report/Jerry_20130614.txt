Today my main work is familiar with shell. Also,I keep learning other linux commands.
Firstly,I read a book about bash files like /etc/profile,/etc/bashrc,
$HOME/bash_profile and so on. The file that is called $HOME/bash_profile is
 personal setting value. The others are system setting value.
Secondly,I learn an important command which is called export. Its function is
 that make a transformation from custom variables to environment variables.It is 
 very important to set the environment variables in shell.
Thirdly,I review the linux file feature and permission. We change the permission
 with the command which is called chmod. Meanwhile the command chown is used
 to change the owner of file .
Next week ,I will commit to the training of linux programing.
