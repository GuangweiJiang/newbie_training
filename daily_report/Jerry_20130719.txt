Today I learn the spin lock which is another way for the concurrency and race
conditions. The main difference between spin lock and the semaphore that I
learned yesterday is the size of critical sections.The former is suit the small
critical sections,or it will be endless loop. The later is good at the big
critical sections. All thought there are still many methods to solve the
concurrency problem, they are not widely used.
At last I write a driver for the NO.5 exercise. There is a error about the
driver. So I will check out next week.
