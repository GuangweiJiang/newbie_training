I have read the linux device drivers many days. It is time to do some exercises.
Today I complete a easy task.
My first linux_driver_training is not hard. I just need to write a simple kernel
module,while I write a makefile to compiled the kernel module. When I use the 
command insmod to load ,there is a problem  that will show me 'operation not 
permitted'.After asking my colleague,I get the answer that is the command sudo.
When I prepare to do the second exercise ,I have many troubles. I have find 
that what I had learned previously is not very well. Especially node I do not 
understand entirely.
