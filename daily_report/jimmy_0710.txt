  Today is Tuesday.The weather is a bit hotter than yesterday.The sun shines
on the face very uncomfortable.
  Today I still go to training.The first class is about standard of workshop
.The teacher is very funny.He talks about the world cup with us.It listens 
like he is disappointed with the Brazil team.Because we are interested in 
football,so the classroom atmosphere is very warm.
  The second class,the teacher teachs us how to write teachnical documentation
.Then he spends a lot of time to introduce the process of the production line.
We learn a lot.
