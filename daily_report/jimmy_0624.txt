parts of functions.Now I just can complete one.I need learn more.
  In the afternoon,we get together to have a meeting for last week.By watching 
the report,I konw what I need to do .Everyone is responsible for a project.They 
need to solve the problem independently.Thus,their ability is very strong.I need
