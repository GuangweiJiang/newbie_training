I write a test program in the user space to check out the correctness of the 
device driver today.
In the test program I give two numbers (99,1111).After compile the program 
and run it, the device driver will show me the words”the first value is 99.”,
”the second value is 1111.”.That means I make it .
At last , I need to check out the format of the programs and write some 
descriptions about the device driver. Thank to the help from my colleagues.
Tomorrow I will go on doing the third exercise.
