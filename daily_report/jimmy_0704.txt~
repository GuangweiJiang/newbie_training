  Today is Friday, the weather is fine.
  Today I mainly learn the konwledge about ioctl.Dozens of pages in the 
book is about this.At first, I am a little not understand.The book is 
written too professional.I spend a lot of time to understand the book 
in terms of ioctl.When I write a program about this, I realize that is 
a very simple.I find that I start to think too complicated.I have come 
across this before, and now could not remember how to do it.I am a little embarrassed.
  Afternoon, I learn some knowledge about the C language.Then I read the 
second C language homework,then I write a program that I feel should be 
on.I am ready to submit after.
