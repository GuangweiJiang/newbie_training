In the morning there is no lesson of the new staff training. I modify the first
weekly programming. First of all, I use the bubble  sort algorithm which has
many time and space complexities.After reading the book Programming Pearls, I
learn the new method which is bitmap sort.The way will conserve memory and have
a higher rate to finish the programming.
In the afternoon I have a lesson that is about abnormal quality. The company 
has a rigorous process to test the abnormal quality and solve all kinds of 
problems. Until the QA leader agrees to cancle the abnomal quality,the production 
can be recovered. At last the teacher emphasizes the importance of details about
the quality.
