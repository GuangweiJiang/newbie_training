Today I keep reistalling the computer system.
During the period,my colleague Albert tries many times to make my computer 
get work.The computer seems can not work any more. Even one of times we 
reistall the computer successfully,there are a lot of functions I can not
use in the computer.Meanwhile I read some books about the GPIO for the NO.8
exercise of the linux driver training.
In the evening,Albert makes it. The computer system comes back.Thank goodness.
At that mement, I just want to say thank you very much Albert.
