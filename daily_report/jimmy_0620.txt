   Today I am still the first to reach the company.After leaving previous work , I do'not get up
until ten o'clock every day.Now I get up very early every day.I'm used to getting up early now.
In the morning I solve the problem about modlue.I make a very low-level mistake.The mistake
is in makefile.Hello is written to Hellow.I am busy all day beacuse of the mistake.Attention 
should be paid to write code later.Director jiang teachs me how to read a book about linux 
drive.I see a whole english book for a long time.I don`t know many words in the book.English
ability needs to be improved.
  At noon I lay down and sleep for a while.It is really comfortable.Afternoon company had agreed
to give me a computer, but there no computer.On Monday I will go to get computer again.Director
jiang tells me take 3 hours from suzhou to kunshan by bike.
