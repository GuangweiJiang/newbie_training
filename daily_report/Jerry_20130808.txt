Today I have to learn the five steps about adding script.
First of all ,it is about building image.I copy the first shell commandsfrom
the hudson after contacting the server and user.Then I change the file mode
which have the first shell commands to make the file to be a executable file.
After that I use the command ./ to execute.Then The mango machine that contacts
the computer at first begin to work. The second step is WCIS test.Also,I copy 
the second shell commands from the hudson. The method is same as building image.
But the WCIS test will result in a report about the test. That is the most 
important for the test. I need to make sure write the right file path to save
the report in the configuration.The other test is similar to the WCIS test.
