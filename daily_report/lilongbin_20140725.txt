I have installed a new operating system(ubuntu 14.04 of 64-bit). Then I need to configure the system as an embedded development environment.
First of all, I should install vim which is a classic editor, vim is much stronger than vi, so I use "alias vi='vim'" to alias vim, when type vi the system will call vim instead. Then I configured the vim through vimrc file in current user's home directory, "set nu" to show line number, "set cindent" to select the indentation mode as C language.
Then I configure the git because the default version in ubuntu 14.04 is git2.0, first of all, we have to use "git config --global user.name $user_name" and "git config --global user.email $user_email" to verify user'd identity; then use "git config --global push.default simple" or "git config --global push.default matching" to select the push method.
When we use "git commit" the commit message default editor nano will be called, if we want to use vim we could use "select-editor" to select vim.gnome as the default one.
