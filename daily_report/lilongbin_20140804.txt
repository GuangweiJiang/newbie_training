From now on, I will study the online training and the deadline is this friday.
First of all, I will learn from the instruction of eform, usage of eform, principle and flow of information service, how to apply information services, the overtime system, how to deal with the exception of checking on work attendance system, the eform to control things coming in and going out, and how to look up an extension of a telephone system.
The eform system is often uesd in the regular work, especially the eform to control things comming in and going out.
I study hard on these courses, and take an exam.
