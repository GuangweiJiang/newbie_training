Today I need to solve the problem between administertor and user in hudson at
first.After trying many times, my colleague,zhou Zhou,find the key to the 
problem.The user's file path is different from the path in the hudson configuration
Next step,I will learn how to creat a project after applying for a node as a 
user.Then I need to configure the security and source code management and so on.
I do the exercise twice. Now I have a little familiar with them.As a user the 
most important thing is adding script.There are five steps about the it.They 
are build and reflash image,WCIS test,CTS test,Monkey test and Benchmark test.
Tommorrow I will learn them.
