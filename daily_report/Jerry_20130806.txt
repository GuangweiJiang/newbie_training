Today I begin to learn the WCIS ceremonially,
First of all, I read the SOP about the WCIS and learn to download the hudson 
resource online.At first I download the latest version hudson 3.0.But there 
are a lot of differences compare to the SOP.Many configurations can not be 
found.So I use the version 2.2.1.The hudson have two sides I need to learn.
One is the administartor side. It needs me to set up hudson, configure 
some options,install the plug-ins and reply messages to the users.The other
is user side. I have to know the usage of hudson,for example,how to apple for
a node on hudson through Email.
At last there is a problem of connection between administartor and user.
