  Today is Monday.The weather is a little hot.
  In the morning,I get a cupboard from other department.I can put things 
into the cupboard.In the morning,I read the book about linux device driver
.At the beginning,my concept of interface is fuzzy.Through reading,I know
some concept,such as I2C,GPIO and spi.I learned this in school before,but
I forget it now.I need pay more attention to this. 
  In the afternoon,I brush the android system into the motorola mobile phone
.I learn a lot of knowledge,such as fastboot,adb.I am interested in this.
