When I finish the new staff training ,I begin with the linux driver training.
Today my task is NO.5 exercise. It is about concurrency and race conditions.
When 2 or more applications manipulate a device at the same time, it may cause
the race. It will lose the memory. To avoid the serious problem we usually
the method of semaphore or the method of spin_lock. In my exercise I use the
semaphore. It needs to initialize the mutex lock ,to acquiring semaphore and
to release the semaphore.
Tomorrow I will keep finishing the NO.5 exercise and reading some materials
about the method of spin_lock.
