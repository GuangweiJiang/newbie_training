Today I go on writing the exercise2 about the linux_drivers_training.
I have completed an integral device driver, but there are a lot of errors and 
warnings with that .The driver is included five file operations (read,write,
open,release,ioctl).Of course ,I imitate some templates. Because of those 
templates in low version,my driver has many warnings.Meanwhile the errors in 
the driver are cleaned with the help of my colleague at last.The reasons have 
many kinds.
Next week I will write a programming to test the driver.
