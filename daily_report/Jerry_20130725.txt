Today I finish the NO.6 exercise of the linux driver training and begin to do
the NO.7 exercise.
The main problem of the NO.6 exercise is delaying operation for a specified
amount of time.One of the methods is long delays. But sometimes a real driver
needs to calculate very short delays in order to synchronize with the hardware.
Then we often use the short delays.
For the NO.7 exercise of linux driver training, I feel a little strange.It is 
about android which I am mot familiar with.That means I meeds to take more time
on the exercise.
