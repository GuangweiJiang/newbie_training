The most important thing is learning how to write a misc device driver today.
We all know that it needs three steps to complete the char device driver 
initialization which included allocate the major and minor ,create the /dev 
and /sys node  and register the device driver. The misc register takes the 
place of the three steps. It implifiea the method to the device  driver 
initialization.
Of course there are still many problems in the driver . Some errors are about 
the function definition and  initialization that I am not good at .Tommorrow 
my job is correcting the errors.
