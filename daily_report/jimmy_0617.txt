my name is jiang zhen hua.my engish name is jimmy.It is my first day for new job.today i wake up at 6:50.then i walk to company.it is about 30 minutes from hostel to factory.at morning HR teach me konwlege about the company.and some law of the company.I learn a lot. afternoon i come tomy working place.I feel environment is very good.workmate is very friendy.I believes I have made remarkable progress in 2014. However, in order to consolidate my performance, I did not explore any innovative ways of working. I think I should adopt myself with more enthusiasms and flexibilities moving forward with my job, improve my control over matters and peoples, be more analytical and logical in dealing with issues, enhance myself with capabilities to cope with challenges ahead.
