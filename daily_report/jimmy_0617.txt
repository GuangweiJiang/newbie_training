  My name is jiang zhen hua.My english name is jimmy.It is my first day for new job.
  Today i wake up at 6:50.After having breakfast i walk to company.It is about 30 minutes from hostel to factory.
In the morning HR tell me a lot of konwlege and laws about the company.I learn a lot.I konw how to how to work 
better with workmates. In the afternoon i come to my working place.I will work at the Seventh Floor of the building.
I feel environment is very good.workmates are very friendy.Leader give me a computer.then teach me what i need to do.
  I believes i have made remarkable progress in 2014. However, in order to consolidate my performance, I did not 
explore any innovative ways of working. I think I should adopt myself with more enthusiasms and flexibilities moving
forward with my job, improve my control over matters and peoples, be more analytical and logical in dealing with issues
, enhance myself with capabilities to cope with challenges ahead.
  I am off duty at 19:30.I go to hostel by factory car.
