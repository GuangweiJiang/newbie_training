Today is monday which is the beginning of the working day in this week. To
have a good start I do the following jobs.
Above all, I make a linux_drivers_training schedule to make sure my tasks 
complete efficiently.
The next job is the second exercise of linux_drivers_training. I learn how to 
make a node and destroy a node and so on. The functions are  class_create, 
device_create, class_destroy and device_destroy.
At last ,I accomplish the second weekly program. It is about adding up the 
quantities of 1 about a number in binary. The method which I used is bit 
manipulation.
