  Today is Wednesday.The weather is good.
  I feel so productive today.I try to change the globalmem driver to misc driver,
But it can not compile.I try to use the method that director teachs how
to debug linux kernel.I finally find a pointer does not apply for the memory.Then,I
learn ioctl about linux driver.I plan to complete the fourth homework tomorrow.
  I do the second homework about algorithm.The second problem is not difficult.It need
have the C landuage operation ideas.Suddenly I feel the training is very good,I need to
chaerish.Through the probation period training,I can learn a lot.
