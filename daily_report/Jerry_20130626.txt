I read a completely char device driver and learn the dedugging techniques.
When I firstly see the device driver ,I feel very complicated. After reading 
that at the first time ,I just find the char device driver is consist of some 
specific functions like the initialization function , the clear function,the 
allocation function and so on. Even though they have a little hard to understand,
I still do my best to learn that.
The debugging technique is another knowledge that I read. I learn some methods 
to debug. First of all, debugging by printing is s useful .Secondly, watching 
is also a good way to debug. Thirdly, we can use a debugger to solve the 
problem. Of course, they have different usages when we debug.
