  Today is Wednesday.The temperature is a little low.I feel it`s gonging to rain
,but I forget where I put my umberlla.Today,not many people waiting in the bus 
queue.I am very lucky.
  Today I learn a lot.Before,my conception of node about linux device is very fuzzy
.Through reading the book guangwei recommended,I understand the concept of node.I 
konw the application is how to send the parameters passed to the driver.Then I try 
to write a globlemem virtual device driver.Although it is an example of the book,but
I studay by writing the device driver to understand more details of the knowledge.
Then I solve the problem about C language algorithm.It is raining,I will walk without
umberlla in the rain.
