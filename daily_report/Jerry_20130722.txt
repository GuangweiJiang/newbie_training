Today I finish the NO.5 training of the linux driver.
There is a error about the programming. At  the beginning I read a lot of header
file materials about the problem on the internet . But the error still exists.
At last I find a  analogous programming on the internet. It does not use the
function init_MUTEX(). It uses the function sema_init(). I imitate the programming.
Then the error is solved.
In the afternoon my colleague Albert recommend a website about the linux device
driver . It contains many Summaries which are written by someone who also starts
learning the linux device driver from zero. Thank very much for the website from
Albert.
