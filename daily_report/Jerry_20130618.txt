Today I go on learning the writing of makefile and the usage of GDB.
In the morning,I mainly look for the information of makefile. I get something
different from yesterday when I have seen. When we write a makefile rule,we
still find many same file names. They make the makefile very complex.To solve
the problem we use the variable instead of the same file names.There are more
usages of makefile on the internet .
In the afternoon, my main job is learning the use of GDB.It is a important tool
to debug the programming. By the way , I attend a meeting with my colleagues. The
meeting is aimed at summarizing what we did last week. At last we talk about
the patent. Some  colleagues have many nice ideas.
