  Today is Friday, I am still very early to the company.
  Today, I supplement the globalmem driver's function.I try to create the device
file node manually.I use "echo" to communicate with device driver.In accordance 
with the requirements,it needs to use the API to create the device file node such 
as class_create, class_device_create.I still don't understand how to do, I need to 
read some books guang wei recommended.Then I write C language homework today, I find
that my C language level is very poor .I don't know some operation symbols.About the 
concept of bit operation, I have not used before.I need to spend more time, more 
efforts to learn.
