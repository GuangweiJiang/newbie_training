Today, I start to design a simple list and some basic operations.
In order to establish the linear relationship between data elements, for each data element, when storing data element itself information, storing the address of the element after him is needed, a node contains of the two pieces of information.
Linked list storage structure is a dynamic management. Each node in the list the storage space is not pre-allocated, but running system according to the need to generate. So establish a single linked list starting from an empty table, each read an element is to apply for a node, and then inserted into the list.
