  Today i am still our dormitory the first one to get up.I buy a notebook on the way.
Because there are a lot of new knowledge needs to be recorded.And I am the first to company.
Forget to shut off the computer when left yesterday.Computer is very hot.Today I feel very
confused.A simple question, I spend all day no good solution.Colleagues living beside me I 
do not know how to solve.I have read a Book.I sill can't solve.To see the director is very 
busy, I do not dare to disturb.I also feel is a simple problem, but I just can't solve. My
colleagues tell me not to have the pressure, take it easy.
  I plan to go back in the evening to solve this problem.This evening i must handle the problem
simple good.Now the problem really many.The computer can automatically shutdown.Going to work
,i not happy, because the problem is not solved.
