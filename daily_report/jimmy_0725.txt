  Today is Firday.The weather is good.
  In the morning,I read the book about the linux device driver.
I know new concept about linux device driver,such as time,delay
,and deferred work.Then the director let us show the homework 
about linux driver.The code design is not good.He offers me some
suggestions.
  Then,we have a meeting.The director teachs us some knowledge 
about electronic hardware.I feel it is really important.I feel 
quite happy.I learn a lot in the new company.
