Today I begin to keep doing the GPIO exercise.
The exercise is building a driver and dump all of the GPIO status.To tell the
truth, I have no ideas about the GPIO which just know that it is general purpose
Input /Output Ports.I have used the GPIO in the single chip computer,but that 
was the usages about hardware.This time seems be different.The materials is about
what is GPIO and how to operate.
In the afternoon I learn the reports about the introductions of GPIO and creating
nodes under /proc and /sys.Especially the last one I learn less about that.
At last my colleague give me some introductions about WCIS.Next week I will learn
the WCIS while doing the linux driver training.
