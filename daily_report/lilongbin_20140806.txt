I finished the remnants of the online training, for example esd and lean production.
Then I write the report of new staff training. Because of the language of the system is chinese traditional, I have to give up using the chinese simplified input method to avoid the messy code.
Furthermore, we start how to create gerrit server during the regular meeting. First of all, installing git-core，openjdk-6-jdk，apache，mysql-server，openssl，and ssl-cert. Then we need to install postfix mail server. when we configre the postfix we should select the general type of mail configuration as "internet site", and the default values should be okay for other questions. If need to change configuration after installed, use command "dpkg-reconfigure postfix".
Then we should configure database server, in the preparation we have installed the mysql and set the root password. Then create group and user for gerrit, generate a default config file for gerrit and fill in the information "GERRIT_SITE=/home/gerrit2", set up gerrit server. At last, we should configure the web server.
