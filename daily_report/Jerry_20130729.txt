Today I am originally intended to do the NO.7 exercise of the linux driver 
traning,but there are some accidents about my computer.
First of all,I build kernel image of a real device. When I make ready to 
run it in the real android device,the computer can not reboot.It makes me 
lost some materials in the computer.Then my colleague Albert help me to 
reinstall the system which is the the latest version of linux system.Unluckly
the version is too high to get work.
Tomorrow I will go on reinstall the system with the help of Albert.
