Today I keep doing the linux_drivers_training. Meanwhile I read some 
information about the misc_register.
On the one hand,I complete the NO.2 exercise of the linux_drivers_training. 
There is no error in the programming with the help of my colleagues. Tomorrow 
I will write a programming to test the correctness of  the exercise.
On the other hand, I look for some information about the misc_register to 
prepare the third exercise of the linux_drivers_training online.
At last I take part in the regular meeting that talk about the progress about 
all projects.
