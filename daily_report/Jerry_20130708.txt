Today I get the e-mail about the training of new staff. In the next week, I
will take part in the training to learn the corporate Culture. The training 
will help us adapt the new environment easily and know the basic knowledge 
about the company.Because of the training,I have to change my linux drive 
schedule.
 Meanwhile I begin to do the fourth exercise of the linux driver training. 
 It is about the  kernel driver  that must used __put_user/copy_to_user and
 __get_user/copy_from_user. It has some differences compared with the one 
 I completed last week.Today I just reed some books about the kernel driver.
