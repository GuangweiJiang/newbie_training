Today I mainly complete two work.
In the morning,I review the kernel module and summarize what I learn yesterday.
In addition, I remember the initialization function and the clear function. 
I read some solutions about errors in the initialization.
In the afternoon,I learn the char drivers. What I have mainly learned is the
design of scull and the major and minor numbers. We usually use the dynamic 
allocation numbers. This method is a mainstream.
Also, I participate in the  weekly meeting.
