Today I write the device driver of the fourth exercise .
In the exercise I did not make many mistakes. I find I just have an integral
understanding about the linux device driver.The fourth exercise is about the
ioctl in the driver.It is used to control the hardware.It is common in the 
most driver.
Tomorrow I will begin my training for the new staff. It means I do not have
much time to learn the new things about the linux driver .But I would 
be going to review and improve the training what I have done at the last two
weeks.
