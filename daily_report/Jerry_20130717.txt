 have the last lesson for the new staff. It is about the basic notebook
 knowledge. The first knowledge we should know is the development history
 of notebook. It has not a long history ,but it has a rapid development.
 Secondly we learn the key parameters of the notebook. It is very useful
 for us to make our notebook work well.
 At last I arrange my daily report. Especially for the report that has
 errors, I correct the mistakes. I find that there are so many mistakes
 in the daily report. Even though they are not serious,they indicate that
 I am not very careful. I should be more more attentive to my tasks.
