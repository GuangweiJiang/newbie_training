  Today is Wednesday.The weather is hot.I get up late,but 
I am not late for work fucklly.
  In the morning,I read a book about GPIO.The device driver
is different from the driver I write before.I need pay more 
attention to this.Through learning this,I know what is GPIO
,and it can be used for what.Then I see the homework about 
GPIO driver written by Allan and zhouzhou.There are great 
differences between them.I feel very confused.I need understand
it,because it is very important.We can not see the video in
the company.I buy a lot of linux driver video from tao bao.I 
am going to go to back to watch the video.
